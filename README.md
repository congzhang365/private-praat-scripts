# private-praat-scripts

Most of the scripts I have here were written by me. The rest are written by others -- usually with their own signatures at the beginning of each file. 
I have detailed comments for only a few of them: see this repository if you're only interested in those.

My plan is to have detailed tutorials -- maybe in video form in the near future. 

There's a starter tutorial here: https://congzhanglinguist.wordpress.com/2019/02/25/scripting-in-praat-001/
